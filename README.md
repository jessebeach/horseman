## A Manifesto

- We want Drupal to be the _preferred_ backend content management system for designers and front end developers.

- We believe that Drupal's main strengths lie in the power and flexibility of its backend; its primary value to users is the ability to architect and display complex content models.

- We believe that client-side front end frameworks are the future of the web

- It is critically important for Drupal to provide a decoupled front end in order to better interoperate with the front end frameworks of today and tomorrow, or risk becoming irrelevant.
